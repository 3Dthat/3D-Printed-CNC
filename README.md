# 3D Printed CNC
This is a 3D Printable CNC machine. I am still working on adding all the wiring, cable chains and endstops.

This is 1500mm x 1000mm. At this size the cost is around $1300. If you make it smaller the cost goes down a lot.

Full Open Source for anyone to use.

You can scale the size by changing the length of the Extrusions, Linear Rails and Ball Screws to the size you want. All the 3D Printed parts will be the same.
